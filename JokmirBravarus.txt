One day, I hope to see them again.","Alignment":null,"Backstory":"Born In a Forest gnome village in the nearby woods of Saltmarsh, Jokmir grew up happily with his father. His mother died giving birth to him. Jokmir and his father, were the hunters of the village. This was because his father had the, according to the village, blessing of the hound. In other words, he was a werewolf. For Jokmir however, even though this curse is passed from father to son, this had never surfaced. The family of 2 was happy in the village.\rAt least until, while on a hunting trip, his father encountered a human. Though rare, it wasn't unheard of for a forest gnome to encounter a human. But this human, it didn't hunt like other creatures. It looked as if it was controlling the prey's blood.\r\"This could revolutionize our hunting!\", he said. \"We will be eating meat at every single meal!\". Which would be very different, as Forest gnomes don't eat a lot of meat.\rObsessed with this idea, Jokmir's father searched for this human in a nearby village. And behold, there he found him. After some convincing, the human ended up teaching Jokmir's father the way of the blood hunters.\rJokmir's father, excited with his new found powers, showed the village what he can do and tried to convince them with his new idea of  hunting.\rThe villagers however, were scared of him. But Jokmir's father kept trying to convince them. Eventually he was chased out of the village.\rThis happenig didn't make life easy for Jokmir. He was getting bullied for his father's actions. \rOne night he got up, noticing a package at the window. It was long, and had a letter. The letter said \"I'm sorry son, for I could not convince the townfolk. I have been surviving off my new found powers, so i won't be needing any weapons no more. That is why i gift you our family longsword.\r\rThe next night Jokmir heard people jelling and chanting.\rLooking outside the window, he saw the towns people marching towards his treehouse. They looked angry, were carrying either weapons or torches.\rIt was time for Jokmir to run.\r\rExciled from his village, he ended up in Saltmarsh. There he found a nice old lady, who would let him stay in her garden. She had a nice large tree, where he could build his traditional Forest Gnome house.\rThere he looked for a blood  hunter to learn from, so he could at least honor his father in some aspect.\rLife was good there. A few years passed. Then the war began... \rAs the war moved north, the south was neglected. Pirates began to thrive in saltmarsh.\rOne day, after coming home from training, he noticed the door to the old woman's home was open. Pirates had plundered the house, and killed the old woman.\r\rFueled by this event, Jokmir hunted pirates in the next few years. Until he found out and tracked the pirates that killed the old woman.\rHe discovered they were planning to raid a warehouse of Councilman Galon Primewater. He had to devise a plan to stop them. But his blood hunter training wasn't yet complete, so he to be smart about this.\rKnowing this, he got to the warehouse a while before the pirates did. He arranged the warehouse in a way, where, with little force, he could let crates swing from the roof, drop them from upper shelfs and more.\rTogether with some creepy sounds and some spooky noises, Jokmir managed to scare away the pirates. Making them think the warehouse was guarded by a spirit.\rFor this, Jokmir was heralded as a Folk Hero, and gained the favor of Councilman Galon Primewater.\r\rThe rest of his years were spent hunting pirates and training in the arts of the blood hunters.","Id":"30e1e4cb-5c77-4a04-9a1a-a0714f7fc982"}
